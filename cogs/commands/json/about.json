This API has been specifically chosen for its accuracy and authenticity over the amount of languages that it can translate. Rest assured, Transword will never be perfect, but it is far better than Google Translate and Yandex, despite having less languages to choose from."

However, if you would like to help support the project in terms of finances, (since APIs don't come cheap when used on a massive scale) then please feel free to my [PayPal!](https://paypal.me/jamesw02) All donations are generously appreciated. ~~In the future we plan on giving donators special perks, too.~~"
